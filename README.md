## Hi there ðŸ‘‹



Young Jedi of Code, currently training as a Junior Full Stack Developer, but already learning the ways of the Force (and JavaScript). As I continue my journey through the galaxy of code, I invite you to explore my work on GitHub: padawanDia. Whether you're looking for a fellow learner or a glimpse into my development universe, youâ€™re always welcome aboard!
